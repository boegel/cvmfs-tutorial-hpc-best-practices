This is an introductory tutorial to [CernVM-FS](https://cernvm.cern.ch/fs/), the CernVM File System,
with a focus on employing it in the context of High-Performance Computing (HPC).

In this tutorial you will learn what CernVM-FS is, how to get access to existing CernVM-FS repositories,
how to configure CernVM-FS, and how to use CernVM-FS [repositories](appendix/terminology.md#repository)
on HPC infrastructure.

## Intended audience

This tutorial is intended for people with a background in HPC (system administrators, support team members,
end users, etc.) and who are new to CernVM-FS; no specific prior knowledge or experience with it is required.

We expect it to be most valuable to people who are interested in using or providing access to one or more existing
CernVM-FS repositories on HPC infrastructure.
