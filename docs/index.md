## Scope

This is an introductory tutorial to using [CernVM-FS](https://cernvm.cern.ch/fs/), the CernVM File System.

In this tutorial you will learn what CernVM-FS is, how to get access to existing CernVM-FS repositories,
and how to configure CernVM-FS on High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure.

## Intended audience

This tutorial is intended for people with a background in HPC (system administrators, support team members,
end users, etc.) who are new to CernVM-FS: no specific prior knowledge or experience with it is required.

We expect it to be most valuable to people who are interested in using or providing access to one or more existing
CernVM-FS repositories on HPC infrastructure.


## Prerequisites

*(more info soon)*

## Practical information

We hope to organise a fully online tutorial using this material some time in Sept-Dec 2023.
